When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
-most especially if your working in a group project.
-if you want to invite reviews to your code from others
-when you intend to work from different places and workstations.

    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-since github is usually done in an interaction environment with other users, 
 its important to check and approve some changes, plus,
  i might have made some more changes to my local version, that may be affected by remote 
  commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    -a fork is a remote repository, cloned within the github systems,right under your github account.
    -a clone is a repository copied to your computer from a remote source.it may also be copied from within your computer
    -a branch is part of a single repository, handling commits with a different context from another


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    -it helps to know when the local is ahead of the remote
    -it helps to identify the new commits made to the remote so as to know how and when to merge
